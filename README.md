**Aura Vision** is an immersive, browser-based music visualization experience. It transforms live audio from your microphone into stunning, real-time generative art.

Powered by **Google Gemini 3.0 Pro**, it goes beyond simple visualization by periodically listening to the audio stream to **identify songs**, detect the musical mood, and fetch synchronized lyrics in real-time. It now leverages **Google Search Grounding** to ensure high accuracy for song identification across global regions.

## 🚀 Features

### 🧠 Advanced AI Intelligence
*   **Gemini 3.0 Integration:** Uses the latest `gemini-3-pro-preview` model for multimodal audio analysis.
*   **Smart Gap Detection:** Automatically detects silence between tracks (e.g., when a song ends). Once the music resumes, it **instantly triggers** the AI to identify the new song, ensuring lyrics and info are always up to date.
*   **Search Grounding:** The AI listens to audio, transcribes lyrics, and performs real-time **Google Searches** to verify track titles and artists. This drastically improves recognition rates for obscure tracks, remixes, and non-English songs (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, etc.).
*   **Source Verification:** Provides a clickable "Source (Google)" link to verify the identified song.
*   **Lyrics & Mood:** Automatically fetches official lyrics (or chorus) and detects the vibe (e.g., "Energetic", "Melancholic") to subtly adjust the UI.
*   **Region Prioritization:** Context-aware identification based on your selected region (Global, US, China, Japan, etc.).

### 🎨 Visualizer Modes
Aura Vision features 8 distinct, mathematically generated visualization engines:

*   **Frequency Bars:** Classic mirrored spectrum analyzer with gradient fills.
*   **Neon Rings:** Concentric circles that expand and pulse with mid-range frequencies.
*   **Starfield:** A 3D particle field that accelerates based on treble/high-hats.
*   **Geometric Tunnel:** A hypnotic 3D tunnel that reacts to the track's energy.
*   **Plasma Flow:** Liquid, organic color gradients that flash and pulse with the beat.
*   **Abstract Shapes:** Dancing geometric primitives reacting to specific frequency bands.
*   **Ethereal Smoke:** Dual-stream smoke flowing slowly from top and bottom, converging at the center to create a mystical atmosphere.
*   **Water Ripples:** Raindrop effects triggered by bass kicks.

### 🎛️ Deep Customization
*   **Style & Themes:** 8 preset color themes (Cyberpunk, Sunset, Matrix, etc.).
*   **Fine-Tuning:** Adjust sensitivity, speed, glow intensity, and motion trails.
*   **Lyrics Styles:** Choose from **Standard**, **Karaoke** (Gradient Pulse), or **Minimal** styles.
*   **Multilingual Support:** Fully localized for **English** and **Chinese (Simplified)**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** React 18, TypeScript
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, Custom Canvas API (2D Context)
*   **Audio Processing:** Web Audio API (`AnalyserNode`, `MediaStream`)
*   **AI Integration:** Google GenAI SDK (`@google/genai`) with Tool Use (Google Search)
*   **Build Tool:** Vite

## 📦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18+)
*   A Google Cloud Project with the **Gemini API** enabled.
*   An API Key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
*   **Note:** Your API key must support the `gemini-3-pro-preview` model and Google Search tool.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aura-vision.git
    cd aura-vision
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory (or ensure your environment provides it):

    ```env
    API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key_here
    ```

    *Note: The application expects the API key to be available via `process.env.API_KEY`.*

4.  **Run Development Server**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

5.  **Build for Production**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

## 🎮 Usage Guide & Tips

1.  **Grant Permissions:** Upon launching, click "Start Experience" and allow microphone access.
    
    > **🎧 Critical Audio Tip:** For the best visual experience, ensure your operating system or browser is **NOT** applying "Noise Suppression" or "Echo Cancellation" to your microphone input. These features filter out music frequencies (bass/treble), making the visualizer look flat.
    >
    > *Aura Vision attempts to disable these automatically, but system-level settings may override this.*

2.  **Controls:**
    *   **Bottom Bar:** Access the control panel to switch modes, change colors, or adjust settings.
    *   **Microphone Icon:** Toggle the visualizer on/off.
    *   **Settings:** Enable "Glow" for neon effects or "Trails" for smoother motion blur.
    
3.  **AI Recognition:**
    *   Play music in the background. The "Listening" indicator will pulse.
    *   Every ~30 seconds (or immediately when a song change is detected), the app records a short clip and sends it to Gemini.
    *   The model "listens," transcribes lyrics, Google Searches them, and returns the result.
